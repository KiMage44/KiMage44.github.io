        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! Welcome to my website! My name is Trenton Choate, and if you are reading this you likely stumbled upon it via my github.
        let me start off by saying thanks for taking time to look, any feedback you have on the website would be greatly appreciated!<br><br>
        Anyways, about me. I'm a 20 year old student at Bossier Parish Community College(BPCC) currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
        So far, I've managed to become fairly proficient in HTML5, javascript, Java, and Python. I plan to add C++ and Rust to that list, but
        I'm not quite there yet. Currently I am set to graduate in fall of 2020 and find a career in the field of development soon after.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my freetime, if I'm not working on a side project, like this website, I'll likely be playing a game or consuming Youtube more than a human probably should.
        I am a bit of an introvert, so on the occasion that I stand up and go outside, I'll typically dribble a soccer ball or drive around town exploring.
        <br>
        <br>
        I don't have much else to say about myself, unless future me comes up with something, so once again, feel free to explore my projects!</p>
